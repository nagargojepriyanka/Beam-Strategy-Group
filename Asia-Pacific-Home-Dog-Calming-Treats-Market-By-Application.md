E-commerce platforms provide pet owners with easy access to a wide variety of calming treats from both established and new brands. The rise in online shopping is largely driven by its convenience, availability of detailed product information, and the ability to compare prices across different brands. In addition, the COVID-19 pandemic accelerated the adoption of online shopping, further increasing the popularity of purchasing pet products online. Consumers also benefit from the ability to read customer reviews and ratings before making a purchase, which builds trust and enhances decision-making. As e-commerce platforms continue to enhance user experiences with faster delivery and better customer service, the online sales of calming treats are expected to remain a dominant force in the market. <h2>Offline Sales</h2> <p>While online sales continue to surge, offline sales through brick-and-mortar stores still play a significant role in the Asia Pacific home dog calming treats market.

Additionally, the trend of pet humanization continues to influence the market, as more consumers view their pets as family members and seek products that promote their well-being. Another notable trend is the growth of CBD-infused pet products, which have gained popularity for their therapeutic effects on anxiety, pain, and inflammation. As pet owners become more informed about the benefits of CBD, the demand for such products is expected to rise. <h2>Opportunities in the Market</h2> <p>The Asia Pacific home dog calming treats market offers several growth opportunities for businesses. One such opportunity is the increasing number of pet owners in emerging economies, particularly in countries like China and India. These regions are seeing a rise in disposable income and an expanding middle class, leading to increased pet ownership.
